# Data Types

## What is a Data Type?

A data type is, as the name suggests, a type of data. Giving each type of data it's own definition enables them to function differently from each other, and posses useful differences, like their own set of methods.

In Python, there are a few core types, with the ability to create your own through classes.

## Boolean

A boolean is the most simplest form of data, only being able to represent two states; on and off.

## Integer

An integer is the type of a whole number.

## Float

A float is the type of decimal numbers.

## String

A string is the type used for words and sentences.

## List

A list stores a multitude of other types of data, or other lists.

## Set

A set is like a list, but can't store identical pieces of data.

## Dictionary

A dictionary is like a list, though it stores values as key/value pairs instead of just values.
