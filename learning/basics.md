# Basics

These sections are things which I didn't think to mention until the user `Spades#8051` \(on Discord\) struggled with them.

## Brackets

## Colons

## Indentation

Python is an indentation based language. Indentation is very important to your code, and with out it, you'll be getting a few good errors.

### Why Did They Do This?

Python is supposed to be a language that is easy to use for beginners. This means that it must be easy to read, understand and write. In a few other languages, indentation doesn't matter whatsoever, and so code can become a lot harder to read.

When indentation is forced, like with Python, it makes code easier to read when skimming or looking through someone else's code.

### When Do I Indent?

Whenever you start a code block, which are started with a colon \("\`:\`"\), the next line will always be indented by one more indentation level. The indentation level of this block must stay the same through out it, but not all blocks have to be indented to the same level, though, for the sake of readability, I recommend keeping your blocks indented to the same level.
