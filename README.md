# Introduction

Welcome to Python: Somewhat of a Guide, a \(hopefully\) simple, open-source guide written by DeflatedPickle for Python 3.6 and beyond.

This guide is meant mainly as a staring place for beginners, but it could also provide some help for those who already know a bit of Python.

It also serves as a quick way to provide an answer to a simple question. Say someone asks how to use functions, you could simply link the function page and be done with it.

I've spent quite a bit of time working on this guide, so if you find it helpful, please share it with others who might also find it helpful.
