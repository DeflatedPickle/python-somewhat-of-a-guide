# Implementations

Python, being a language favored by many, has quite a few different implementations. An implementation being a form of Python that is run in a different way and/or written in a different languages. Examples of different implementations consist of Jython, which runs on the JVM and can interact with Java code and IronPython, which runs on .NET and can interact with C\# code. These other implementations are not official and can sometimes be for older versions, as they usually have small teams working on them. The main and official implementation of Python is CPython.
