# Scopes

## What is a Scope?

A scope in Python is where named objects, such as classes, variables and functions, are kept.

## Local Scope

### What is the Local Scope?

The local scope is the current active scope. If you create a function, a new scope will be created with it and assigned to it. Any named objects created inside of it, will belong to it and won't be accessible from another scope. 

## Global Scope

### What is the Global Scope?

The global scope is a scope like any other, except, it can be accessed from any other scope. If you needed to create a variable in one function but use it in another, one way to use it from the other function, would be to, in the first function, make it a global variable.
