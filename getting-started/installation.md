Click on the hyperlink, and you'll be taken to the release page for that version. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see a section titled "files". These are the files for the version that you can download.

If on Windows, you'll want to download the "executable" for x86 if you have a 32-bit machine, or for x86-64 if you have a 64-bit machine.
