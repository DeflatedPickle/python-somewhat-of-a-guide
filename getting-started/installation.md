# Installation

To get started with Python, you'll probably want to install it on your machine. This can be done by going to [the Python website](https://python.org), and moving to the "download" box. You should see a piece of text next to a hyperlink saying "latest". This will be the latest version of Python, which is typically want you want to install. Click on the hyperlink, and you'll be taken to the release page for that version. Scroll to the bottom, and you'll see a section titled "files". These are the files for the version that you can download.

If on Windows, you'll want to download the "executable" for x86 if you have a 32-bit machine, or for x86-64 if you have a 64-bit machine.

If on MacOS/OSX, you'll want to download the "macOS 64-bit/32-bit installer" or the "macOS 64-bit installer".

If on Linux, you'll want to run `sudo {your package manager's command for installing packages} python3`, for example `sudo apt-get install python3` on Debian or `sudo yum install python` on Red Hat.
