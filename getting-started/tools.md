## Editors

When writing and working with Python code, you'll need an editor to be able to read and write code. You can get by just using Notepad, or whatever default text editor comes with your OS, and then running the Python file, but this can be tedious and intuitive, as most editors weren't meant for code and lack a lot of useful tools to help with writing code.

## Text Editors

Text editors are the most basic type of editor, they range from Notepad to Sublime Text to Vim. Some will have useful tools for editing code, such as line numbers and line and syntax highlighting.

## IDEs

IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments, are like text editors, but they're specifically for working with code, and come with many tools that help with coding, such as debugging tools.
