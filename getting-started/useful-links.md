# Useful Links

As well as this book or even instead of, it's a good idea to use information and resources from many places, so I'd like to link here and explain, a few places I've found useful.

## [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)

The official Python docs are the main place to go if you need to find something Python related, they have a page for just about everything and update the docs with new Python releases. Though their pages tend to go on quite a bit, and they'll usually provide information that might confuse a newcomer, like the grammar syntax for different statements.

## [Effbot](http://effbot.org/)

Effbot is a great place to learn Python, with their own book on the standard library, a book on learning Tkinter, and another book for learning PIL and some code snippets. However, most of the information on this site, whilst helpful, is most likely outdated. For example, their Tkinter guide hasn't been edited since 2005.

## [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

Stack Overflow is a site where you can ask questions and view and/or answer other peoples questions. It's great if you want to ask a question, though they do have some strict rules on asking questions, which should be taken into consideration before asking there, and chances are, your question has already been answered on the site, so you can usually find what you need easily. And if you do, make sure to up-vote the person's answer that you found helpful.

## [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/index.htm)

#### [\(Python 2\)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)

Tutorials Point is another great place to learn Python, with both a guide for Python 2 and Python 3.
